# How Public and Private Infrastructure Embrace Big Data and the Consequential Problems
In this document, I will address how Big Data and related technologies are embraced in public and private sectors and the resulting data leakage issues by scrutinizing two _New York Times_ articles. 

## Article 1
In Qin, Liu, and Chien's [Chinese Police Database Was Left Unsecured Long Before Hackers Seized It](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/07/business/china-police-database-hack.html), the reporters unveil the sociopolitical implications of the leak of Shanghai police database. In short, digital surveillance on citizens' online movements not only invades people's rights to privacy but also puts the country's national security in danger. As the article says: 

> The breach is “a big black eye” for the Chinese security apparatus, one expert says, exposing the risk of the state’s vast effort to amass citizens’ personal data.

## Article 2
In Joseph Goldstein's [Hospital and Drugmaker Move to Build Vast Database of New Yorkers’ DNA](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/12/nyregion/database-new-yorkers-dna.html), the author introduces how hospitals are now collecting patients' genetic information for medical and scientific breakthroughs. However, albeit leading to medical achivements, how the database of genetic sequences buttressed by a vast amount of patients's DNA is protected from leaking remains unclear. As a professor of Biomedical Informatics at Yale University points out:

> Our collective knowledge of mutations and what illnesses they are associated with — whether Alzheimer’s or schizophrenia — would only increase in the years ahead, he said. “If the datasets leaked some day, the information might be used to discriminate against the children or grandchildren of current participants,” Dr. Gerstein said. They might be teased or denied insurance, he added.
